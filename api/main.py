# Entry point for the FastAPI app.
#
# Run it with:
#     cd hackathon-starter-kit/api
#     pip install -r requirements.txt
#     uvicorn main:app --reload
#
# This API is standalone - it does NOT serve the frontend. It's meant
# to be deployed as its own Docker Space on Hugging Face (see the
# Dockerfile and README.md in this folder), with the "client" folder
# deployed separately as a Static Space.

# a different *.hf.space domain in production), so the browser enforces

# Space secret/variable in production, e.g.
# "https://your-username-your-client-space.hf.space".
